    "\n",
    "                            Preamble\n",
    "\n",
    "  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\n",
    "software and other kinds of works.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\n",
    "to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\n",
    "the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\n",
    "share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\n",
    "software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\n",
    "GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\n",
    "any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\n",
    "your programs, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n",
    "price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n",
    "have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n",
    "them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n",
    "want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n",
    "free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n",
    "\n",
    "  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n",
    "these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\n",
    "certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\n",
    "you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n",
    "gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n",
    "freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\n",
    "or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\n",
    "know their rights.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n",
    "(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n",
    "giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n",
    "that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\n",
    "authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\n",
    "changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\n",
    "authors of previous versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n",
    "modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\n",
    "can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\n",
    "protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\n",
    "pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n",
    "use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\n",
    "have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n",
    "products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\n",
    "stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\n",
    "of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n",
    "States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n",
    "software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\n",
    "avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\n",
    "make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\n",
    "patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n",
    "modification follow.\n",

    "  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\n",
    "in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\n",
    "exact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\n",
    "earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n",
    "\n",
    "  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\n",
    "on the Program.\n",
    "\n",
    "  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\n",
    "permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n",
    "infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\n",
    "computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\n",

    "for making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\n",
    "form of a work.\n",

    "\n",
    "  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\n",
    "convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\n",
    "in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\n",

    "with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\n",
    "the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\n",
    "not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\n",
    "for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\n",
    "and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\n",
    "your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\n",
    "the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\n",
    "makes it unnecessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n",
    "\n",
    "  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\n",

    "users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\n",
    "technological measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n",
    "\n",
    "  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\n",
    "receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n",
    "appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\n",

    "  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\n",
    "produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\n",
    "terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n",
    "    it, and giving a relevant date.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n",
    "    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n",
    "    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n",
    "    \"keep intact all notices\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n",
    "    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n",
    "    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n",
    "    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n",
    "    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n",
    "    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n",
    "    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n",
    "    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n",
    "    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n",
    "    work need not make them do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\n",
    "works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\n",

    "parts of the aggregate.\n",
    "\n",
    "  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\n",
    "of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\n",
    "machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\n",
    "in one of these ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n",

    "    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n",
    "    customarily used for software interchange.\n",

    "    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n",
    "    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n",
    "    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n",
    "    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n",

    "    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n",
    "    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n",
    "    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n",
    "    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n",
    "    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n",
    "    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n",
    "    with subsection 6b.\n",
    "\n",
    "    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n",
    "    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n",
    "    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n",
    "    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n",
    "    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n",
    "    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n",
    "    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n",
    "    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n",
    "    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n",
    "    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n",
    "    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n",

    "    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n",
    "    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n",
    "    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n",
    "    charge under subsection 6d.\n",
    "\n",
    "  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\n",
    "from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\n",
    "included in conveying the object code work.\n",
    "\n",
    "  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\n",
    "tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\n",
    "or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\n",
    "into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\n",
    "doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\n",
    "product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\n",
    "typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\n",
    "of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\n",
    "actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\n",
    "is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n",
    "commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\n",
    "the only significant mode of use of the product.\n",

    "User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\n",
    "fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\n",
    "Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\n",
    "by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\n",
    "if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\n",
    "modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\n",
    "been installed in ROM).\n",

    "  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\n",
    "requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\n",
    "for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\n",
    "the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\n",
    "network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\n",

    "  7. Additional Terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\n",
    "License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\n",
    "Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\n",
    "be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\n",
    "that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\n",
    "apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\n",
    "under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\n",
    "this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n",
    "remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\n",
    "it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n",
    "removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\n",
    "additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\n",
    "for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\n",
    "add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\n",
    "that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n",
    "    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n",
    "\n",
    "    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n",
    "    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n",
    "    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n",
    "\n",
    "    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n",
    "    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n",
    "    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n",
    "\n",
    "    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n",
    "    authors of the material; or\n",
    "\n",
    "    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n",
    "    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n",
    "\n",
    "    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n",
    "    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n",
    "    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n",
    "    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n",
    "    those licensors and authors.\n",

    "your receipt of the notice.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n",

    "transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n",
    "licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\n",
    "give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n",
    "Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\n",
    "the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n",
    "rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\n",
    "not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n",
